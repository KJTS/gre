## House

[Villa de Plassac]({{<relref ".">}})

## House Description

The village of Plassac lies 4 kilometers south of Blaye and about 30 kilometers north of Bordeau on the right (east) bank of the Gironde estuary.  The Gallo-Roman villa stood on the slope of Montuzet at the place called Clos du Chardonnet, near the estuary of the Gironde.  The present parish church of St. Pierre-aux-liens occupies part of the site, which covered more than 5000 square meters.  Discovered in the 19th century in the course of expansion of the church, the villa has been the object of successive campaigns of excavation by G. Emard between 1963 and 1974 and probes by J.-P. Bost in the 1970’s.

### Garden Description
Three villas followed one another on the same site between the reign of Tiberius and the fifth or early sixth century.  The Julio-Claudian villa was built facing the Gironde around the year 30.  The Julio-Claudian villa was built facing the Gironde around the year 30.  Excavations have brought to light on the river side a grand reception room, combining no doubt a triclinium with a belvedere over the river with the unusual feature of an inward-bowing excedra in a flattened arc 38 meters across on the river side. On either side of this room, to north and south, were structures on two levels.  This first villa lasted until at least sometime around A.D. 100.  It was then demolished, and the lower levels were filled in to make a terrace that gave a firm footing for the new structure.  A new grand room was built, still facing the river but this time further forward and resting on a straight wall on the river side.  The room had very thick walls which would seem to indicate an upper floor.  Even from the lower room one could enjoy a magnificent panorama over the Gironde to the front and the gardens and buildings to the rear.  It was luxuriously ornamented with an opus sectile.  There was perhaps a portico on the façade overlooking the river.  Directly behind the belvedere room was a courtyard bordered by porticos in a U shape.  The northern arm of this U was a double portico, which formed the south side of an interior peristyle which was interpreted as a garden by the excavators.  Thus was formed a vast esplanade, a rectangle elongated in the east-west direction and divided in its center by the east-west running double portico.

The northern side of the villa was an external gallery, paralleled on the inside by an ornamental pool 51 meters long, of which one of the long sides has been brought to light.  In this reception wing, rooms alternate with courts open to the sky.  In the center, a vast room centered on the pool made a passage to the central peristyle.  It is flanked in an original manner by two smaller, lateral rooms, placed in two, small, symmetric courts, both covered with marble plaques, both on the walls and on the floor, so that they do not seem to have been used as gardens.  
In the east wing, the apartments were organized symmetrically on either side of a central room, flanked by two little rectangular courts planted as gardens.  A drain made of tegulae runs around these two spaces.  It is pours into the interconnected open channels which run along the porticos of the peristyles of the villa.  Some have interpreted this system as ornamental, but one may lean rather towards the interpretation as drains leading the rain water of the roofs to the river.  This central room allowed one to pass from the central peristyle to the next to the north, still incompletely excavated, but perhaps also planted as a garden.

The villa saw prosperous days from the time of Trajan to that of Constantine.  It then disappeared, a victim doubtless of its age, to be reborn in a third phase.  For this period, a labyrinth of late walls makes it difficult to read the logic of the whole.  Around 400-430, the eastern wing, the best known, took on its present form, including a bath sector and a series of reception rooms, one of which had a vast polygonal apse on the outside.  They all open onto a gallery of the peristyle, of which half is known.  The northern wing lost its character of a reception area.  It was modified several times and seems to have become a granary or service areas such as a kitchen or stable. Further north, what must have been the park of the second and third centuries was occupied by workshops and then by a late necropolis.  The long ornamental pool was filled in during this third phase.  The south wing disappeared perhaps in late antiquity, while the buildings of the fourth century are known by probes under the presbytery of the present church.
