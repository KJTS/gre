## House
[Villa at the Pont d’Oly]({{<relref "../../../..">}})

## House Description

This luxurious villa of late antiquity is most remarkable for having been built on either side of a sizable stream, the Néez, which rises in the Pyrenees and flows into to the Gave on its left bank.  This unique feature, however, proved the villa’s undoing, for the Néez changed its course and swept away a large part of the residential sector of the villa on its right (east) bank.  The site has been known since 1770 and was excavated and mapped in the nineteenth century.  A large area on the left bank was uncovered between 1850 and 1853 by a young English tourist, S. Baring Gould.  Because of work on the bed of the Néez, there were salvage excavations on the right bank site in 1989-90 by G. Fabre and R. Monturet, but the results  remain largely unpublished.

### Garden Description

Each building covered about 2000 square meters with an elongated rectangular plan, and the two faced one another across the stream.  The parallel long axes of the two buildings run to the north-northeast, but in this description we will take this direction as north.   Each building had a portico façade parallel to stream.  In the better preserved residential building on the west bank, this portico was about 30 meters long, had six columns, and was closed off at the north and south by roughly square pavilions.  The scant remains of the building on the right (east) bank are consistent with the idea that each façade would have seemed to reflect the other.  From the rear of the east bank building one looked out to the east onto a large semicircular courtyard.  The courtyard was enclosed by a gallery running in a semicircle drawn with a radius of about ten meters and its center in the middle of the back wall of the building. Nothing is known of what was in the courtyard – indeed, half of it and the central portion of this house were completely carried away by the Néez.  It would, however, have been a natural place for a garden beautifully visible from the central room of the house.  Beyond this semicircle, further to the east, there was a vast rectangular space organized in a U [XIII – XIV].  Again, nothing is known of what was in its open area but a garden is certainly a possibility. The baths, the best known part of the structure, were connected to the house on the west bank.
