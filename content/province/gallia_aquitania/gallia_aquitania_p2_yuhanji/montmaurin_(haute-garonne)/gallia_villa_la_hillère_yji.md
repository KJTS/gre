## House

[Villa la Hillère]({{<relref ".">}})

## House Description

The villa of 1500 square meters has been known since 1865 and was excavated between 1963 and 1965 by G. Fouet.  Prompted by the spring, a medieval chapel on the foundations of one of the rooms, and the adjacent cemetery, he had interpreted the site as a water sanctuary.  It has been more recently been recognized as a residence, but opinions vary.  It is a rare example of fourth century construction on virgin land.

### Garden Description

 It has two distinct buildings. The main, more southern one has a courtyard [P] (31 x 8 m) with three galleries in a U open towards the river.  It was once thought there had been a pool in the middle of the U, but it could not be attested by recent investigators.  A large,  reception room [M] (9.8 m square) with mosaic floor was entirely open toward the river thirty meters ahead, thus strongly suggesting that the area in front of it had been, if not a garden, at least pleasantly landscaped.  About ten meters back of the bottom of the U and roughly in line with its northern arm was the the spring, which was surrounded by a hexagonal pool.  The more northern building begins fourteen meters northeast of the center of the pool, and its main front wall points directly at the spring.  Water from the spring was channeled off to the northeast between the two buildings and to the south-southwest.  The area around the spring thus formed a sort of “water court” framed on two sides by the buildings.  The main entrance to the southern building was from this court.  It would seem safe to speculate that this well-watered area was nicely landscaped, perhaps with trees and shrubbery.
