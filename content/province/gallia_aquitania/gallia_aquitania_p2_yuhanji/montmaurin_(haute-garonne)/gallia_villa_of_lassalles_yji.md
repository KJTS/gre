## House Descriptions

The site was noted in 1864 and was the subject of archaeological research by Abbot Couret between 1879 and 1882.  The first systematic excavations began in 1947 and continued under the direction of Georges Fouet until 1960.  The very complete publication, based on the state of knowledge at the time, made this villa one of the “celebrities” of Gaul and indeed of the western empire.

The villa of late antiquity was built on earlier structures going back to the middle of the first century.  The plan of this early phase proposed by Fouet was made on the basis of probes and remains very hypothetical; it cannot be analyzed with any certainty.  Gardens were quite possibly part of this vast pars urbana of the early empire, especially given its size and connection with agricultural structures.

According to Fouet, after a period of abandon between 285 and 325, there followed two phases of work, the first in the time of Constantine and the second around the middle of the fourth century.  This second phase, following a fire, saw some transformations in the villa and the creation of the rooms at the northeastern end.  The last major phase of construction was thus superimposed on preceding buildings while keeping their orientation and a large part of their lines and proportions.  The agricultural buildings, however, do not seem to have been used in the late period. Note that, in this chronology proposed by Fouet, the villa reached its final phase around the year 350.

And then, with the progress of archaeological science, this chronology came to be much discussed.  By the mid 1990’s, it was generally agreed that the history of the site had to be revisited and that only by a careful re-evaluation of the old excavations and by the establishment of a precise plan of archaeological work could a whole series of questions be answered about a residence often cited for comparison,but in the end, it itself is not sufficiently well known.  The general result of this work has been to recognize that the date given by Fouet for the second phase of the villa as “about 350” is considerably too early; an early fifth century date would be more plausible.

### Garden Description

The villa’s main axis runs southwest to northeast; but to avoid complex directions, we will rotate the compass rose and refer to northeast as “east”, the northwest as “north” and so on. In these terms, the main axis of the villa runs from west to east.    The domain of the presently visible villa extends over 18 hectares, the area defined by the walls along the north and west and by the river on the south.  The monumental façade along the west side runs 117 meters, while from the front gate on the west side to the tip of the final aspe on the east is 126 meters, for a squared-off  “footprint” of nearly 15,000 square meters for the main structure.
The main part of the villa of late antiquity was organized with a quite symmetrically around the west-to-east axis.  On arriving from the west, we would have encountered first the long wall of the west façade. The entry was flanked by two rooms [139 and 140] that were then extended by a gallery to the left and right out to two pavilions [64 and 67] which marked the ends of the great semicircular forecourt to be met on entering.  As we stepped inside the central entrance, the semicircle of porticoes reaching towards us would have seemed to be the architectural extension of the welcoming arms of the host coming to greet us.  The radius of the inner circle was about 28 meters; and of the outer, about 32 meters. On the inside, the porticoes had marble columns which rested on a low wall.  A central walkway stretched ahead, but there can be little doubt that gardens filled both halves of this forecourt, for Fouet carefully noted, “a thick, rich paleosol bordered the porticoes and extended into the two halves of the courtyard up to the central passage.”

To the left of the passage was a little temple of the fanum type (11.5 x 7.5 m). The central altar was a hexagon, while the wall around it was a hexagon elongated towards the south.  Two phases of the southern half of the wall have been noted, one more elongated than the other.  The excavations yielded numerous offerings, of which six were votive altars, two with dedications, one to Jupiter and the other to Tutela.  Fouet dated the construction of the temple to after 350, or in his terms, after the construction of the forecourt.

On crossing the courtyard, we would come to a step up and two large square pillars marking the entrance to the residence proper.  Behind the pillars was the porch [62] flanked on either side by heated rooms [55] and [56].

Continuing through the large square room [61], we would have finally reached the grand central peristyle [90] (33 x 30 m) with porticoes about 2.85 meters wide around all four sides.  The columns were no doubt marble and were placed on a low wall.  Its height is not known precisely.  As for the portico of the semicircular court, the site presently shows only a simple stylobate.  Around the porticoes were the rooms for daily life, of which a number were heated.

The open part of the courtyard (26 x 23 m) showed no evidence of an ornamental pool.  Fouet noted a central east-west passageway about four meters wide which connected the two pairs of large masonry pillars (.9 x 1.1 m in section) in the center of the east and west sides.  Originally, they must have supported structures whose height accented the main axis of circulation in the house.  Was there a garden in this courtyard?  Fouet reported that there had been three different pourings of mortar, but never on the whole surface of the courtyard.  Moreover, he demonstrated zones of planting around the border of the peristyle. “In them, a thick paleosol of rich, dark earth replaced the last cementing, and the previous layers of mortar had remained only in places.”   

Continuing on ahead, we would have come into a second courtyard (11.5 x 12.1 m), room [27]. The organization of this courtyard poses several questions of interpretation, some of them bearing directly on the question of whether there were plantings here.  In particular, the six rectangular structures along the north and south walls [5, 6, 7 and 28, 29, 30] are puzzling. They look a bit like small pools, and indeed they are lined on the inside with rose mortar that may be hydraulic and are covered on the outside with marble.  One problem with the pool interpretation, however, is that no means of bringing in water or draining it away was found.  The discovery of a quantity of oyster shells in one of them led to the implausible hypothesis that they were for keeping live shellfish.  Three other clues to their purpose are: (1) they have been restored with walls that are too thick, (2) the walls of the courtyard were pierced with windows above the structures and otherwise covered with marble plaques except between these structures, and there, in old excavations, the Abbot Couret noted a large quantity of mosaic tessera of glass paste – numerous cubes of light blue, of dark blue, and even some with a gold backing, and (3) in one of the structures was found, reutilized in a burial, a beautiful marble statue of  a woman, a Victory or Venus-Victory according to Stirling.  Fouet proposed that the structures were holders for planters.   One would thus have had marble-paneled walls setting off the colors of the flowers or shrubs in the planters in front of them and, between the planters, mosaics of predominantly blue tones with gold accents. Statues may also have stood between the planters.

According to Fouet, the central area of the courtyard, originally was paved with marble, but then in a final phase “the marble paving was pulled out to make place for lots of dark, rich soil.”  So the courtyard became, or became again, a garden.

Today, if we want to continue eastward in the house, we can easily do so by going up the steps at [12] or [14].  But these steps were built by Fouet, and it is not certain that there were any originally here.  So we will do well to go back to the large peristyle and use either the corridor [97, 4] on the south or [37, 22] on the north.  As noted above, these would have been illuminated by the windows over the planters.  Off of these corridors open apse-like semicircular porticoes [11 and 26] with gardens in their central areas [10 and 24].  The outer walls of these porticoes were reinforced by fourteen pilasters placed close together, so we can be reasonably sure that there were no grand bays looking out on gardens beyond.  Rather, the gardens in these apses seem intended to embellish the way to the highest reception space.

Continuing on further east and up more steps we reach that space, the reception area [16, 17, 18].  This space was flanked by two rooms to the north and two to the south.  Given its elevated position, it must have played a major role.  Fouet thought that [17] (5.1 x.6.55 m) was an open space, covered with a trellis, to be enjoyed in the summer.  The floor was covered with four large slabs of white marble with blue-gray veins; all four slabs were sawn from the same block to create a pattern with two axes of symmetry.  To either side, up one step, opened an elegant room with marble threshold, floor, and walls, with pilasters and roof sloped towards the central room. Two gutters made of imbrix tile still visible ran along the thresholds of [16] and [18] to carry rainwater to the space [19]. Fouet noted the possible presence of fountains in the northeast and southeast corners of room [17]; their presence cannot be verified today.  The state of the ruins does not allow a clear opinion to be formed on the function of this unusual space nor on the question of whether [17] was, in fact, open.  

In the space [19] at the tip of the axis of the villa, Fouet saw a little garden, but this interpretation is open to question.  The level of the walls of [19] is about 2.9 meters below that of [17], and the apse has been much restored and shows several phases.  It is possible that this room belonged to a previous phase of the villa and was not part of the final structure. (See Morvillez, 2001, p. 37-38).

Despite the very axial character of the villa, the visitor never had a perspective of the whole.    Rather, distinct spaces unfolded as one moved through the house. Very “mineralized” spaces with sumptuous marble revetments alternated with zones of luxuriant plantings.
The baths run off to the north from the northwest corner of the rooms around the rectangular peristyle.  They are connected to the main house by a courtyard with porticoes and a semicircular apse at the west end.  Fouet called the area “the nymphaeum”;  but in a recent careful restudy of this wing, A. Bouet (1997) argues that this name was inappropriate.  The porticoes had marble columns resting on a low wall. The eastern end of the open space [115] was paved with marble.  The western end, [114], was a pool 90 centimeters deep.  Finally, a little garden filled the center of the circular apse at the western end. There was perhaps a central fountain. Fouet thought there might have been a fountain with a water ladder in the northern portico at the opening towards room [132].  Bouet (pp. 220-221, Fig. 5) contends that this suggestion also should be forgotten.  There are, however, small semi-circles cut out of the edges of the steps which Fouet interpreted as a water ladder.    They fit well with the water-ladder interpretation and otherwise make little sense.

Further east, on the axis of this courtyard, was a room with an apse [117] preceded by a vestibule with two columns.  This little room was carefully paneled with marble and decorated above the plinths with paintings.  There was perhaps originally a fountain in the apse.  According to Fouet, at a certain time, the marble paving of the courtyard was pulled up and soil brought in to make a level garden in the whole of the space [113, 114, and 115].  It contained, no doubt, one or possibly two marble sculptured groups related to the myth of Adonis, for scattered fragments were found in the excavation (Stirling, 1994 and 1996, pp. 220-222; Demeures, pp. 233-236.).
On his plan, Fouet indicates “exterior gardens” accessible by the corridor [120] which runs along the north of the room with apse [117].  He conjectured in [142] a portico with Tuscan capitals that sheltered a fountain of which only the drain has been found.  In his view, the whole formed a pergola (4 x 12 m) open to the gardens to enjoy cool air from the north in the summer.
