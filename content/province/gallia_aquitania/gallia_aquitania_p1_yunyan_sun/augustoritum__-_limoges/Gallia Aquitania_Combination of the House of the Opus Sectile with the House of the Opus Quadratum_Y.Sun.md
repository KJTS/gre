## Location

[AUGUSTORITUM  - Limoges]({{<relref ".">}}) \
[Augustoritum (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138203)

### Location Description

The earliest traces of settlement in this area are at the oppidum of Villejoubert 25 kilometers east of the city.  The Roman settlement of Limoges proper dates from about 15-10 B.C. and was named Augustoritum (Augustus’s ford) in honor of the emperor.  It covered some 65 to 100 hectares and was laid out in a regular rectangular grid. The ancient wall dates from the end of the third century.  The town took water from several sources, including the aqueduct of Aigoulène; there were drains for waste water disposal.  There were several public fountains and baths, a theater, an arena, and temples.  The city declined in the fourth century. Its Roman name was replaced by the Celtic name of the local people; and its regular street pattern, almost totally lost.

### Garden Description

In the first half of the second century, the combination of these two beautiful houses made for  truly sumptuous quarters.  The residence, opening off of a vast vestibule with a central pool, covered an area of 5500 square meters, the whole of the insula. In the first phase of the work, heating was installed in the two reception rooms.  Enjoyment of the east garden [1] of around 500 square meters was enhanced by a double-asped, 1.2-meter-deep  pool in its center.  It disappeared in a fire between the third and fourth century.  In a second phase of embellishment, not prior to the years 226-235, the luxury of the décor was heightened.  The reception room [2] was paved with a rich carpet of geometric opus sectile framed by a border of white marble, while new marble plates suppressed the old. To room [3] was added a large apse to the north, also furnished with a luxurious pavement of opus sectile and ornamented with a mosaic on either a wall or perhaps a semidome.  The semicircle of this apse was constructed at the expense of a service courtyard.  This courtyard [4] was bordered on the east by a portico which sheltered under its roof a well with a monolithic puteal.
All of this magnificence was destroyed by fire in the late third or early fourth century.
