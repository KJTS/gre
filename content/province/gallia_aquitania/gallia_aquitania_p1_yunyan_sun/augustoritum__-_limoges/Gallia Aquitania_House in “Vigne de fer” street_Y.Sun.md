[AUGUSTORITUM  - Limoges]({{<relref ".">}}) \

### Location Description

The earliest traces of settlement in this area are at the oppidum of Villejoubert 25 kilometers east of the city.  The Roman settlement of Limoges proper dates from about 15-10 B.C. and was named Augustoritum (Augustus’s ford) in honor of the emperor.  It covered some 65 to 100 hectares and was laid out in a regular rectangular grid. The ancient wall dates from the end of the third century.  The town took water from several sources, including the aqueduct of Aigoulène; there were drains for waste water disposal.  There were several public fountains and baths, a theater, an arena, and temples.  The city declined in the fourth century. Its Roman name was replaced by the Celtic name of the local people; and its regular street pattern, almost totally lost.

### Garden Description

This house at the corner of rue Vigne de fer and Boulevard Gambetta was discovered during salvage excavations in 1962.  The garden [1] was exposed only for 6.1 by 9 meters, but its length is thought to have been more than 20 meters.  A low wall, 60 centimeters high, with a rounded top bore the 4.45 meter high colonnade.  The combination, which it was possible to reconstruct conceptually, had a coating painted red and black plinths accented with a fillet.  The walls of the gallery were painted; rectangular red panels alternated with narrower, vertical black panels enhanced by wreaths and chains of foliage and fruits, cupids, masques, and birds.  The lower register was a sequence of wild animals.   The house was destroyed by fire.
