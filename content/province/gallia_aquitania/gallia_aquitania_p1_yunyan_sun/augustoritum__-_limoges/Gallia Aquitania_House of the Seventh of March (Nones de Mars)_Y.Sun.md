### Location Description

The earliest traces of settlement in this area are at the oppidum of Villejoubert 25 kilometers east of the city.  The Roman settlement of Limoges proper dates from about 15-10 B.C. and was named Augustoritum (Augustus’s ford) in honor of the emperor.  It covered some 65 to 100 hectares and was laid out in a regular rectangular grid. The ancient wall dates from the end of the third century.  The town took water from several sources, including the aqueduct of Aigoulène; there were drains for waste water disposal.  There were several public fountains and baths, a theater, an arena, and temples.  The city declined in the fourth century. Its Roman name was replaced by the Celtic name of the local people; and its regular street pattern, almost totally lost.

### Garden Description

Uncovered between 1982 and 1991, this vast residence south of the forum opens to the east onto the Cardo maximus.  Constructed between A.D. 30 and 40 on a high artificial terrace, it occupies 3734 square meters, half of insula IV-6.  Remodeled in the second or third century, it is sometimes considered a schola, but without certainty.
Beyond a large atrium and a tablinum comes a first central peristyle [1] (25.1 x 20.8 m = 522 sq m) with Corinthian and Tuscan columns.  In the middle is a rectangular pool 9.87 meters long fed from the town’s public aqueduct through a vaulted tunnel 52 meters long.  A vast, T-shaped room for entertaining, the principal triclinium of the house, is centered on this peristyle, opening onto it through a large bay.  On the further side, this room extends, along its whole length into the vast garden [4] (26 x 29 m).  Embellished with triple Tuscan porticos in a U, it forms the second part of the house.  The west portico provides access to a series of rooms which complete this vast residence.
