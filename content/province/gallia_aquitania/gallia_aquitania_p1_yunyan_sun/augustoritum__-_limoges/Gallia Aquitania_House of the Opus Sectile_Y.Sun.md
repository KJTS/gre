[AUGUSTORITUM  - Limoges]({{<relref ".">}}) \
[Augustoritum (Pleiades)](https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138203)

### Location Description

The earliest traces of settlement in this area are at the oppidum of Villejoubert 25 kilometers east of the city.  The Roman settlement of Limoges proper dates from about 15-10 B.C. and was named Augustoritum (Augustus’s ford) in honor of the emperor.  It covered some 65 to 100 hectares and was laid out in a regular rectangular grid. The ancient wall dates from the end of the third century.  The town took water from several sources, including the aqueduct of Aigoulène; there were drains for waste water disposal.  There were several public fountains and baths, a theater, an arena, and temples.  The city declined in the fourth century. Its Roman name was replaced by the Celtic name of the local people; and its regular street pattern, almost totally lost.

### Garden Description

This house occupied part of insula VI-5, across the street to the west of the forum.  Constructed a little after the middle of the first century, it filled a space of 2300 square meters and certainly had an upper story. It consists of a living wing to the north of a garden with porticos [1] of 560 square meters.   The south portico has preserved traces of a low wall on which the columns rested ; its inside had a coating painted black.  The quality of the main reception room centered on the garden [3] (10 x 5.65 m), one of the most important rooms, is hard to judge because of the modifications  in the following stage connected with installation of a hypocaust.  The second reception room to the east [2] is ornamented by coatings painted in the Pompeian third style.
