### Location Description

The earliest traces of settlement in this area are at the oppidum of Villejoubert 25 kilometers east of the city.  The Roman settlement of Limoges proper dates from about 15-10 B.C. and was named Augustoritum (Augustus’s ford) in honor of the emperor.  It covered some 65 to 100 hectares and was laid out in a regular rectangular grid. The ancient wall dates from the end of the third century.  The town took water from several sources, including the aqueduct of Aigoulène; there were drains for waste water disposal.  There were several public fountains and baths, a theater, an arena, and temples.  The city declined in the fourth century. Its Roman name was replaced by the Celtic name of the local people; and its regular street pattern, almost totally lost.

### Garden Description

Situated west of the forum, part of insula VI-5, this house had two successive stages. The first is called House of the Lion Emblema; the second, House with the OpusQuadratum. Each occupied about 2300 square meters.  
The House of the Lion Emblema was organized around a central garden with peristyle [1] of 20 by 23 meters.  The floor of the porticos is white concrete with calcite aggregates.  The columns supporting the roof of the portico rest on a low wall covered by a coating painted red.  To the north, in the axis of the garden, was the triclinium [2] (12.6 x 7.8 m) where were found two black-and-white carpet mosaics, with the emblema of the lion in the more northern one.  South of the garden, it is worth noting, there was a bath.
For no apparent reason, this beautiful house was destroyed and another, the House of the Opus Quadratum, was superimposed on the previous foundations, keeping practically the same plan.  The garden with portico [1] of 440 square meters had in the northern part a foundation for a pool or perhaps for monumental stairs connecting the portico to the garden.  The limestone columns were apparently Corinthean. The northern portico had a floor of opus signinum; the floors of the other galleries were bare.  To the north, the reception room [3] was reduced in length to 9.8 by 7.8 meters, but flanked by symmetric rooms with larger mosaics than those of the preceeding phase.  This room, lying in the axis of the possible pool or steps, was embellished by a luxurious paving with an opus quadratum motif  made of marble rectangles.  South of the garden, an important room [4] (12 meters on a side) serves as a vestibule for the main room and marks the end of this house, which was later connected to its neighbor  In the center of the room was a pool with a rim and paving of white marble and a water jet in the center.
