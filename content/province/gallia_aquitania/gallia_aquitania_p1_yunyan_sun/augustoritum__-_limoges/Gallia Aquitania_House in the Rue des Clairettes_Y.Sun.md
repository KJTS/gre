### Location Description

The earliest traces of settlement in this area are at the oppidum of Villejoubert 25 kilometers east of the city.  The Roman settlement of Limoges proper dates from about 15-10 B.C. and was named Augustoritum (Augustus’s ford) in honor of the emperor.  It covered some 65 to 100 hectares and was laid out in a regular rectangular grid. The ancient wall dates from the end of the third century.  The town took water from several sources, including the aqueduct of Aigoulène; there were drains for waste water disposal.  There were several public fountains and baths, a theater, an arena, and temples.  The city declined in the fourth century. Its Roman name was replaced by the Celtic name of the local people; and its regular street pattern, almost totally lost.

### Garden Description

This house was discovered in the excavation of 1998 in the rue des Clairettes.  Constructed in the first half of the second century, it dominated the street.  Only the wing running east-west is known.  A portico must have opened onto a large garden to the north [1].  In the axis of this garden was the central room [2] of the wing with 125 square meters. In the center of this room was a large square pool, several times remodeled.  Originally it was paved with marble or limestone and fed by an underground vaulted tunnel that crossed the whole room.  To the south opened another portico overlooking a terrace two meters below; the street which defined the southern border was on beyond.
