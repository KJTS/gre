## House
Barat-de-Vin

### House Description
Two kilometers east of Sorde-l’Abbaye, beside the ancient road from Dax to Pamplona sat this structure on a terrace above the former bed of the Gave.  The ruins have been known since the second half of the nineteenth century.   They were partially excavated by J. Lauffray between 1957 and 1966.  He considered the structure a villa.  Later, Boyrie–Fénié and Bost (1994) conjectured that it was a wayside inn.  Balmelle is inclined, on the basis of architecture and décor, to the villa interpretation.

### Garden Description
There are two structures separated by thirty meters or more.  It is thought that they may have been connected by a peristyle not yet found. The more southern, lower structure is remarkable for the height of the remaining walls, in some places more than three meters.  The southeast wing of this structure includes a large gallery [XI] (41 x 5 m) that ran parallel to the stream.  It had large bays separated by columns of green marble.  This unit made a sort of belvedere which connected the baths on the northwest to a large pavilion at the southeast extremity. Both the pavilion and the baths belong to a phase of construction in the fourth century.  There is a spring between the stream and the baths, which may account for their location.  Two possible locations for gardens may be conjectured: (1) between the gallery and the stream, and (2) in a possible peristyle between the upper (eastern) and lower (southern) known structures.
