## House
Villa of Sorde-l’Abbaye

### House Description
This villa covering 2000 square meters is in the center of the town, only a few meters from the bank of the Gave d’Oloron and inside the enclosure of the Abbey of Saint John, begun in 975.  The abbey follows the orientation of the villa and covers part of it.  The villa was noted in 1873 and excavated between 1957 and 1966 by J. Lauffray. At least three phases of work and embellishment have been detected.

### Garden Description
It has two peristyles of very different sizes.  The larger (30 x 22.5 m ), to the northwest, is trapezoidal in shape; the sides running in the north-south direction are parallel, but the other two are not.  It had marble columns.  One of the galleries (20.8 x 4.3 m) had a mosaic floor with stars formed by two squares and other geometric and figured motifs.  They are tentatively dated at the end of the fourth or early years of the fifth century.  The second, smaller peristyle in the southern part of the house (about 15 x 14 m on the outside and 8.5 x 7.2 m on the inside) was surrounded by galleries 2.3 meters wide.  At an even later period, it connected the baths – along the south side near the river -- to the main body of the house.  The geometric mosaic decoration are very late – sixth and even perhaps seventh century.  Though without pools or other direct evidence, both peristyles are possible locations for gardens.  Remarkably, the site was occupied, seemingly without interruption, until the beginning of the Middle Ages.
