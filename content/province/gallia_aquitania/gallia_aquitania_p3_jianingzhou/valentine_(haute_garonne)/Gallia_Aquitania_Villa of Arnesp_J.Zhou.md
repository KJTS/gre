## House
Villa of Arnesp

### House Description
This vast, 8,400 square meter villa sits at the edge of a natural terrace overlooking the right bank of the Garonne, which may have been closer then than now.  It entrance was about fifty meters north of the Roman road running from Tolosa (Toulouse) to Lugdunum Convenae (Saint-Bertrand-de- Comminges). To the south, the high Pyrenees rise dramatically on the horizon.  The construction is primarily of river-bed stones washed down from the mountains and showing a great variety of geological origin. There is also white marble from Saint-Béat and black and green marble from Campan and Sarrancolin, all a little south in the foothills of the Pyrenees.    Water brought from thermal springs near the present village of Labarthe Rivière in the foothills played an important role in the life in the villa. Baths to the southwest have been exposed since the nineteenth century.  Later, excavations directed by G. Fouet between 1949 and 1981 demonstrated occupation of the spot from the early empire.  Partial publications suggest a date for the principal construction in the the fourth century and important remodeling in the fifth.

### Garden Description
The villa has a very linear and symmetric plan running north-south. On entering from the south, beyond the façade, one came into a long, rectangular court (52 x 21.45 m) bordered by two walkways which had walls towards the courtyard. There is no evidence that these walls supported columns, but they may have had windows or open arches or wooden columns or a trellis; we simply do not have enough of the walls vertically to know what sort or openings there were.   Through the center of the courtyard ran a small, marble-lined channel, about a foot wide, bringing water from the south.  Otherwise, the organization of the open space in the center of the courtyard is not known. At the northern end of the courtyard was a colonnade façade, behind which opened a semicircular peristyle of Tuscan columns with its straight side on the north.  Its center was occupied by a large, D-shaped pool (14.2 x 9.5 m) with its circular part concentric with the peristyle.  The pool was covered with marble and surrounded by colonnade and closed by a balustrade.  On beyond was a long room running east-west with apses at either end.  The next room to the north on the axis of the structures to the south was of unusal form and luxuriously decorated.  Its fundamental form was an octagon inscribed in a square, but in the corners of the square cut off by the octagon were niches in the form of three sides of an octagon.  Presumably there were statues or perhaps plants in them.

Behind this room, further north, extended a large peristyle thought to have been about 48 by 41 meters.  The floors of the galleries were of opus signinum.  The center of the peristyle was presumably a garden, but all of the area except about eighth in the southwest corner was destroyed by the construction of the canal and road in 1931.  The water that had crossed the forecourt and filled the deep pool presumably irrigated also this area and then, beyond the gallery at the north end of the peristyle, descended to a lower area, where it may also have used to advantage in a garden.  Near the point where it would have descended there was found, in the course of construction of the canal, a downspout in the shape of a lion’s head.  It is now lost.  Various items from the villa are in museum in the town of Valentine.
