## House
Villa at Glesia

### House Description
On the right bank of the Midou, there was discovered in 1868 a large villa with much marble and numerous mosaics.  A salvage excavation in 1976 only glimpsed the remains, and they are now known unfortunately only from a very schematic plan and sketchy descriptions.

### Garden Description
The villa was built around a large courtyard (88.6 by 31.6 as read from the plan), which may have been a garden.  It does not seem to have been surrounded in the usual way by porticoes, but one should not put much trust in the very simplified plan. There are, however, façade galleries on several sides.  The separate baths, situated below the house near the river, were connected to the villa a series of flights of steps with landings between them.  Along the southeast two-thirds of the southwest façade, a gallery runs between two reception rooms, a feature shared with the villa de Baptest at Moncrabeau, though in the present case, the gallery seems to have been double.   Moreover, according to the descriptions of the excavations, each end of the exterior gallery (65 x 3.78 m) was terminated by an apse, a form found in other plans in this region and elsewhere.  At the southeast end, in a feature characteristic of late antiquity, a trilobed room opened off of the reception room and extended beyond the basic rectangle of the house, as if to allow the enjoyment of the surrounding grounds.
