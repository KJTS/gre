## House
Domus Campniac called “House of the Polylobed Impluvium”


### House Description
Discovered by chance in 1889 in gardens near the Rue de Campniac, southeast of the Vésonne Tower sanctuary, these ruins were explored in 1908-09 by Charles Durand, who produced a rather accurate plan and description.  This rich domus covering 2500 square meters was called at the time of its discovery the “House of the Polylobed Impluvium” because of the form of the pool which covered much of the court of the peristyle.  Its final state, the only one thoroughly known, goes back to the beginning of the third century, though old probes indicated that there were without doubt earlier phases.

### Garden Description
The slightly trapezoidal courtyard (roughly 17.6 by 13.8 meters) is surrounded by a low wall, preserved up to 38 centimeters, which supported the colonnade.  The floor of the galleries was a simple pebbled concrete.

The courtyard is fully occupied by two pools, one within the other but separated by a masonry structure of elaborate outline.  The inner pool (5.4 x 8 m) had three semicircular apses on the long (north and south) sides and two on short (east and west) sides.  The outside walls of the masonry structure were straight on the long sides but marked off rhythmically on the short side by three apses of the same dimension as those of the inner pool. (All apses are concave when seen from the water they touch.)  The interior and exterior walls were made of brick and lined, like the bottom, with a soft limestone called Chancelade. The core of the masonry mass was mortared rubble.  The central pool was probably fed by a lead pipe which must have come in from the southwest corner which has been destroyed.  The drainage is unknown.  The surrounding pool was connected to two channels, one going off to the west near the northwest corner and the other to the north near the northeast corner.  According to the excavator, they served, respectively, to drain and fill the pool.  The low wall supporting the colonnade was covered with stone plates held in place by a layer of red, possibly hydraulic, cement. What we have called the “central” pool was, in fact, not precisely in the center; the limb of the outer pool on the south side is about a meter wider than that on the north.

One can well imagine, following a hypothesis proposed after excavation, planters or space for plantings on the upper part of the masonry mass between the two pools.  

Onto this courtyard totally devoted to water there opened on the south a large reception room [D] with a semicircular apse at its southern end.  Its entrance was flanked by two symmetric rooms.  On the north side of the courtyard, room [G] had a luxurious marble floor.  The mosaics are datable to the Severin period.
