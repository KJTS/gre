House of “the Visitation”

### Garden Description
In its first-century form, this rather luxurious house was organized around a courtyard with porticoes.  The reception room was in the north gallery, its entrance from the gallery flanked by a pilaster on either side.  The garden, in the center of the courtyard, measured at least 12 meters on a side and had a well. A rectangular pool, still incompletely exposed, ran along this north gallery and hooked around to run along the west gallery for several meters.  Symmetry would suggest that it did the same on the east, but that is not presently known for certain.  A large apse opens in front of the reception room.

At the end of the first century, the house underwent architectural modifications, but it was not raised to compensate for the rise in the level of the nearby street.  The apse of the pool was filled in, while a small pool was added in the center of the garden.  A new gallery was added on the west side of the courtyard.  The house seems to have been destroyed by fire and abandoned from the end of the third century.  By the second half of the fourth century, its site had become a quarry for materials.
