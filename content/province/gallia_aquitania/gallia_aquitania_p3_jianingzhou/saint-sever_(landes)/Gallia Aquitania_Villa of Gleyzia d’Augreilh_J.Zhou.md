## House
Villa of Gleyzia d’Augreilh

### House Description
This vast villa of at least 2700 square meters was situated on an alluvial terrace (36 m above sea level)  on the left bank of the the Adour.  It was noted and explored in the 19th  century; modern excavation began in 1969 and has continued up to the present under the direction of Dr. Paul Dubedat.  Occupation of the site may go back to the early empire, but the main phase of construction was in the fourth or fifth centuries.

The villa is a rare case in domestic architecture of two very large, twin, symmetrically placed peristyles of almost the same size.

### Garden Description
The floors of the galleries surrounding all four sides of both peristyles were completely covered with mosaics.  The eastern peristyle (31 x 25.5 m) was slightly larger (820 compared to 800 m2) and had geometric and plant motifs such as vines and stalks of acanthus leaves in the mosaics. The western peristyle gave access to baths.

The peristyles look like ideal places for gardens.  They were not paved, and the soil throughout the area is rich bottom land.  In his book, Dubedat says nothing about the courtyards in Gallo-Roman times; there is currently no direct evidence that they were planted.
