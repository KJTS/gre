### Location Description

Timgad, ancient Thamugadi was founded as a colony under Trajan. The city had a checker board plan, that measured 11ha. In the center was the forum with its Curia, an imperial temple and the basilica. Between the IInd and the IVth century the city expanded out of its original layout. Temples, baths and a market were built and the center of the city was renovated with the construction of the library, the market and luxurious houses. At the end of the IVth century the bishop Optatus of Timgad a prominent member of the donatist church constructed the great west basilica. During the Byzantine conquest a fortress was erected on the water sanctuary dating to the IIIrd and IVth century.

<!--## Sublocation-->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE “PALATINE HILL”](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

### Garden Description
This large house was laid out around two peristyles (A,B) arranged along the N S axis. The plan presents a complex layout notably in the southern part of the domus upon which the excavators did not comment thoroughly (Plan view, Fig. 1).

The S part of the domus was probably added in a latter period. It presents a peristyle (B) on which a reception room (C) projected and a series of galleries terminating with an apsidal form. The N peristyle (A) had four porticoes, the S gallery was a continuous colonnade that crossed the W and E porticoes. On the N and W, a vestibule and reception rooms opened towards the peristyle (A). A large rectangular basin oriented NS was placed on the axis of the vestibule, which projected into the courtyard. It seems that the S reception room (C) opened also toward the N peristyle (A). Along the NS axis a semi-circular basin projecting into the peristyle (B) and facing a reception room was placed in between the fourth and the fifth columns. The courtyards of the peristyles may have been planted.
