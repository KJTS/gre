      <description>Province Gallia_Aquitania Gallia_Aquitania (Pleiades)
Province Description Ancient Roman colony (founded 118 BCE) and senatorial province located in modern southern France, along the Mediterranean. This province had stronger cultural and political ties to Italy than the rest of Gaul.
Location BENEHARNUM Lescar
Bene(h)arnum (Pleiades)
Location Description Today, Lescar is a small suburb of Pau, about ten kilometers to the northwest. In Roman times, however, it was the site of Beneharnum, a major city of Aquitania that gave its name to the Bearn region. Its center was at the edge of the high bluff rising above the valley of the Gave de Pau, a site now marked by the Romanesque church of Saint Julien. There are numerous Roman remains in the area, and the Office de Tourisme has organized a 5.5 kilometer, self-guided loop tour of them, including the site of the Villa Saint-Michel, about 200 meters south of Avenue Carrérot, on the east side of the chemin de Ferré. The site, however, is privately owned. Part of the villa was destroyed in building the owner&amp;rsquo;s house; the rest has been reburied and is under a lawn. A beautiful geometric mosaic and some artifacts, including a scythe blade, may be seen at the museum, which is in front of the west façade of Saint Julien..
Garden Villa Saint-Michel
Keywords  galleries (upper level spaces) mosaic  Garden Description From a high terrace about a kilometer east of the ancient Beneharnum, the residents of this suburban villa covering some 2000 square meters could look out over the valley of the Gave de Pau and on to the majestic, sharply outlined peaks of the Pyrenees on the horizon. Discovered in 1886, it was excavated by M. Bats and J. Seigne in 1968-70. The first phase of the construction was probably around the middle of the first century and included a courtyard.
A remodeling occurred around 100 – 150. The main entrance was from the north by a semicircular peristyle with 12 columns and a diameter of 18 meters. The carpet mosaic of the gallery depicted this colonnade projected upon the floor and with a garland of foliage suspended between each support.
The center of the villa was organized around a rectangular peristyle (33 x 26 m). Both the galleries and the central part were covered with mosaics, but in the southeast corner a floor of pebbles surrounded a masonry mass interpreted by Bats and Seigne as possibly a structure to hold planters. A gallery 45 meters long ran along the south façade of the villa and offered a splendid panorama over the valley of the Gave de Pau and on to the Pyrenees beyond.

Location AUGUSTORITUM - Limoges
Augustoritum (Pleiades)
Location Description The earliest traces of settlement in this area are at the oppidum of Villejoubert 25 kilometers east of the city. The Roman settlement of Limoges proper dates from about 15-10 B.C. and was named Augustoritum (Augustus’s ford) in honor of the emperor. It covered some 65 to 100 hectares and was laid out in a regular rectangular grid. The ancient wall dates from the end of the third century. The town took water from several sources, including the aqueduct of Aigoulène; there were drains for waste water disposal. There were several public fountains and baths, a theater, an arena, and temples. The city declined in the fourth century. Its Roman name was replaced by the Celtic name of the local people; and its regular street pattern, almost totally lost.
Garden House in “Vigne de fer” street
Keywords  gallery  Garden Description This house at the corner of rue Vigne de fer and Boulevard Gambetta was discovered during salvage excavations in 1962. The garden [1] was exposed only for 6.1 by 9 meters, but its length is thought to have been more than 20 meters. A low wall, 60 centimeters high, with a rounded top bore the 4.45 meter high colonnade. The combination, which it was possible to reconstruct conceptually, had a coating painted red and black plinths accented with a fillet. The walls of the gallery were painted; rectangular red panels alternated with narrower, vertical black panels enhanced by wreaths and chains of foliage and fruits, cupids, masques, and birds. The lower register was a sequence of wild animals. The house was destroyed by fire.
